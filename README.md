# Ugle
Prototype of a program meant to create snapshots of multiple git repos scattered
across the filesystem, and dependencies installed with 'Spack'

## Notes

# TODO: Snapshot of python packages -> Conclusion: People needs to create a
# venv, Pipfile.lock, etc and version control these files in order to snapshot
# the python packages.

# TODO: Snapshot of javascript packages -> Conclusion: use npm-lock.json
